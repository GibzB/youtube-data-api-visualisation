# Youtube-data-api-visualisation

Use Youtube Data API to visualise subscriber statistics of kenyan youtube channels

## Tools

Implemented the analysis with the use of Pandas and Seaborn

## Use Case

Attempted to visaulise Kenyan youtube channel subscriber count of the top 50 channels based on subscriptions.

### Why 50 channels?

Google API has a request limit of 50 calls per request using their Data API

Who do you think takes the top ten spots?

| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 |
| - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | -- |
|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |    |

I also analysed and visualised each of their well performed videos.
